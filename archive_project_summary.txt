---------------------------------
Name      = EE2026_enhancement
Directory = C:/Users/aloys/OneDrive/Desktop/EE2026_enhancement

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.
