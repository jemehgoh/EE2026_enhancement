## Spot It!

A Vivado project written in Verilog built for the group project component for the EE2026 module at the National University of Singapore.

The program comprises an interactive spot-the-difference game with the following features:
* Selectable difficulty (easy/hard)
* Up to eight differences, chosen randomly
* A "hot-and-cold" system that shows the proximity of the cursor to a difference (in easy mode)
* A difference counter, implemented on the development board's 7-segment display

Details on the implementation of the game can be found in the [project report](project_report.pdf).
